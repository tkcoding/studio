- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-studio-featstatus-traceability-validation`

## 1. Feature Context

- [ ] `p1` - `cpt-studio-feature-traceability-validation`

### 1. Overview

Deterministic quality gate that scans artifacts for ID definitions and references, scans code for `@cpt-*` traceability markers, validates structural contracts and cross-references, and provides query commands for navigating the ID graph. All checks are single-pass, stdlib-only, and produce machine-readable JSON reports with file paths, line numbers, and actionable fixing prompts.

### 2. Purpose

Catches structural and traceability issues that AI agents miss or hallucinate — without relying on an LLM. Ensures that every design element has a unique ID, every reference resolves to a definition, every checked reference implies a checked definition, and every `to_code` ID has a matching code marker. Addresses PRD requirements for ID and traceability (`cpt-studio-fr-core-traceability`) and CDSL instruction tracking (`cpt-studio-fr-core-cdsl`). Artifact validation and cross-artifact consistency capabilities are provided generically by the core Validator for any installed kit.

### 3. Actors

## 2. Actor Flows (CDSL)

### Validate Artifacts

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-studio-flow-traceability-validation-validate`

**Actor**: `cpt-studio-actor-user`

**Success Scenarios**:
- User runs `cfs validate` → all registered artifacts validated, cross-references checked, code traceability verified, PASS with coverage report
- User runs `cfs validate --artifact <path>` → single artifact validated against its constraints, cross-references checked against all artifacts

**Error Scenarios**:
- Artifact not found in registry → ERROR with message
- Template structure mismatch → FAIL with heading contract details
- Cross-reference to undefined ID → FAIL with definition hint
- Code marker references non-existent artifact ID → FAIL with orphan details
- Codebase entry registered with FULL traceability but resolving to no files → WARN naming the entry, so a run that checked nothing says so
- Checked `to_code = true` ID with no code marker anywhere → FAIL, independent of how many files the scan resolved
- No checked `to_code = true` ID and no code → PASS; nothing is claimed, so nothing is owed

8. [x] - `p1` - Collect JIT-retrieval readiness warnings for a document: gathers all four signals below over *every* heading level, independent of whatever level cap the caller configured for TOC-completeness checking - `inst-toc-jit-readiness-collect`
9.

### Document Index

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-studio-algo-traceability-validation-doc-index`

**Input**: Markdown file path

**Output**: `cfs doc-index`'s JSON is `{file, cache_hit, total_lines, section_count, sections, section_level, retrieval_section_count, retrieval_sections}` -- every heading's own line range in `sections[]` (`{level, heading, line_start, line_end, summary}`), plus a coarser "one chunk per real section" grouping in `retrieval_sections[]` at an inferred heading level, each with a content hash and a summary slot. The underlying cached index dict additionally carries `schema_version`, `path`, and `etag`.

A cached, read-once-per-file structural index for Markdown JIT retrieval (see
constructorfabric/studio#104): parsing a file's headings/section boundaries
happens once, not once per query, until the file's content actually changes.
The cache-validity fingerprint is deliberately metadata-only (`mtime` + file
size via `Path.stat()`), never a content hash — the point of the cache is to
avoid reading the file at all on a hit, and a content hash would defeat that
by requiring the read it's meant to save.

1. [x] - `p1` - Build a fresh structural index: parse headings + line ranges from current content, compute the stat-based fingerprint, stamp the current schema version - `inst-doc-index-build`
2. [x] - `p1` - Load a cached index for a file, validated against current stat metadata (no content read on a hit) and against the required-field shape at the current schema version; returns `None` if missing, stale, corrupt, or an incomplete/outdated shape - `inst-doc-index-load`
3. [x] - `p1` - Persist an index to its cache location atomically (temp file + `os.replace`, so a concurrent reader never observes a torn write); no-ops silently outside a Studio-adapted project - `inst-doc-index-save`
4. [x] - `p1` - Return the cached index or build-and-cache a fresh one; reports cache hit/miss for benchmarking - `inst-doc-index-get-or-build`
5. [x] - `p1` - Attach a one-line, LLM-authored summary to a cached section by its `line_start`, for a future per-section-summary caller - `inst-doc-index-annotate`
6. [x] - `p1` - Infer which heading level represents one retrievable section: the most-recurring level wins over a level that appears only once (however shallow), since PDF-conversion heading levels don't reliably encode true nesting depth — a fixed level assumption silently produces a degenerate mega-section on such documents - `inst-doc-index-infer-level`
7. [x] - `p1` - Group headings at exactly the inferred level into retrieval sections (off-level headings stay inside whichever section they fall under, never split one apart); hash each section's own text for section-granularity staleness detection - `inst-doc-index-retrieval-sections`
8. [x] - `p1` - Diff the current file against its last cached build at section granularity: which retrieval sections are unchanged vs. changed, or whether the section count itself changed (a structural change, matched by position not heading text, since duplicate titles are real) - `inst-doc-index-diff-stale`

**Supporting**:
- [x] - `p1` - Stat-based cache-validity fingerprint (`mtime_ns` + size); resolved from the file's own path, never a content hash - `inst-doc-index-etag`
- [x] - `p1` - Resolve the cache file location within the Studio directory owning the indexed file, resolved from the file's own path (not the process's working directory) - `inst-doc-index-cache-path`

## 5. Definitions of Done

### Artifact Structural Validation

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-studio-dod-traceability-validation-structure`

The system **MUST** validate each artifact against its kit-defined constraints: heading contract (required sections, levels, patterns), ID format (`cpt-{system}-{kind}-{slug}`), priority marker presence, CDSL step consistency (checked parent implies checked steps), and parent-child checkbox consistency. Validation **MUST** produce errors with file path, line number, and actionable fixing prompts. Self-check **MUST** verify kit examples pass template validation before proceeding.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-studio-flow-traceability-validation-validate`
- `cpt-studio-algo-traceability-validation-validate-structure`

**Covers (PRD)**:
- `cpt-studio-fr-core-traceability`

**Covers (DESIGN)**:
- `cpt-studio-component-validator`
- `cpt-studio-principle-determinism-first`

### Cross-Artifact Reference Validation

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-studio-dod-traceability-validation-cross-refs`

The system **MUST** validate cross-artifact relationships: every ID reference resolves to a definition, checked references imply checked definitions, checked definitions imply checked references, and coverage rules from `constraints.toml` are enforced (required cross-references between artifact kinds). All consistency violations **MUST** include line numbers and artifact paths.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-studio-algo-traceability-validation-cross-validate`

**Covers (PRD)**:
- `cpt-studio-fr-core-traceability`

**Covers (DESIGN)**:

- `cpt-studio-principle-traceability-by-design`

### Code Traceability Validation

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-studio-dod-traceability-validation-code`

The system **MUST** scan code files for `@cpt-*` markers (scope markers and block markers), validate marker structure (pairing, no empty blocks, proper nesting), and cross-validate against artifact IDs: orphaned markers (code references non-existent ID), missing markers (`to_code` IDs without code markers), forbidden markers (`to_code` ID with unchecked task checkbox), and CDSL instruction-level cross-validation. DOCS-ONLY traceability mode **MUST** prohibit all code markers. Single-pass scanning **MUST** complete in ≤ 3 seconds per artifact.

### Traceability Query Commands

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-studio-dod-traceability-validation-queries`

The system **MUST** provide CLI commands for navigating the ID graph: `list-ids [--kind K] [--pattern P]` (list definitions matching criteria), `where-defined --id <id>` (find definition location), `where-used --id <id>` (find all references), `get-content --id <id>` (extract content block). All commands **MUST** output JSON, scan all registered artifacts, and use exit codes 0 (found) / 2 (not found).

**Implements**:
- `cpt-studio-flow-traceability-validation-query`
- `cpt-studio-algo-traceability-validation-scan-ids`

**Covers (PRD)**:
- `cpt-studio-fr-core-traceability`

**Covers (DESIGN)**:
- `cpt-studio-component-traceability-engine`
- `cpt-studio-seq-traceability-query`

### CDSL Instruction Tracking

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-studio-dod-traceability-validation-cdsl`

The system **MUST** scan CDSL instruction markers (`inst-{slug}` suffixes in numbered list items) from FEATURE artifacts, associate each instruction with its parent ID, track checked/unchecked status, and cross-validate against `@cpt-begin/@cpt-end` block markers in code. Missing implementations and orphaned code blocks **MUST** both produce errors.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-studio-algo-traceability-validation-scan-cdsl`

**Covers (PRD)**:
- `cpt-studio-fr-core-cdsl`

**Covers (DESIGN)**:
- `cpt-studio-component-validator`
- `cpt-studio-component-traceability-engine`

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `cfs validate` validates all registered artifacts and produces JSON report with PASS/FAIL status
- [x] `cfs validate --artifact <path>` validates a single artifact against its constraints
- [x] Heading contract validation catches missing required sections and wrong heading levels
- [x] ID format validation catches malformed `cpt-*` identifiers with line numbers
- [x] Cross-artifact validation catches undefined references, checked/unchecked mismatches, and coverage gaps
- [x] Code traceability validation catches orphaned markers, missing `to_code` markers, and unchecked-task markers
- [x] CDSL instruction tracking catches missing `@cpt-begin/@cpt-end` blocks and orphaned code blocks
- [x] DOCS-ONLY mode prohibits all `@cpt-*` code markers
- [x] `cfs list-ids`, `where-defined`, `where-used`, `get-content` return correct JSON results
- [x] Validation of a single artifact completes in ≤ 3 seconds
- [x] Full project validation (all artifacts + code) completes in ≤ 10 seconds for typical repositories
- [x] All validation errors include file path, line number, and actionable fixing prompt
- [x] All commands output JSON to stdout and use exit codes 0/1/2
